# MODEx Frontend

This was my very first web project, built during my **first year, first semester at university**.  
The code might look a little messy — and I intentionally kept it that way.  
After a few years, I want to look back and see the mistakes I made and how much I’ve grown since then. 🚀

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Live Project
The project is live here: [MODEx Live](http://modexessential.atwebpages.com/Home_page/index.html)  
⚠️ Note: This hosting does **not provide SSL**, so the URL is HTTP. If you visit the link, **don’t panic** — it’s normal.  

## Note
This project is not cleaned or optimized. It’s uploaded here as a reference to my learning journey.
